Console version:
    1. Implemented a very basic command line rock-paper-scissors game using scanner and console.
    2. Make sure that you open this game in the pure terminal or command line window instead of running it directly in this
    IDE.
    3. Follow the instructions that printed on the screen to play the actual game


Advanced version (Mixture of Networking and Graphical aspects):
    Running Main.java in that package and starting a server before creating any game
